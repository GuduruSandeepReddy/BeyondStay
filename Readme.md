## Overview

**BeyondStay** is a full-featured web application designed to allow users to list, browse, and review vacation rentals. It serves as a comprehensive platform for property owners to manage their listings and for guests to find and review accommodations.

This project is deployed at [BeyondStay on Render](https://beyondstay.onrender.com).

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and logout using Passport.js with local strategy.
- **Listing Management**: Property owners can create, edit, and delete their listings, complete with image uploads using Multer and Cloudinary.
- **Review System**: Users can leave and delete reviews for listings they have stayed at, with validation to ensure high-quality feedback.
- **Image Upload**: Listings include image upload capabilities, with images stored securely via Cloudinary.
- **Ownership Restrictions**: Only the creator of a listing or review can delete or edit their content. The edit and delete options are only visible to the creator of the listing or review, ensuring privacy and control.
- **Session Management**: Secure session management and persistent logins using express-session and connect-mongo.
- **Flash Messages**: Instant feedback to users on actions performed, such as successful login, signup, or error handling, using connect-flash.
- **Data Validation**: Robust data validation for both listings and reviews using Joi schemas to maintain data integrity.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Enhanced error management with custom ExpressError class and centralized asynchronous error handling using wrapAsync utility.
